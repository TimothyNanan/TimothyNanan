Instuctions- Flare tech Challenge

User Instructions
The purpose of the application is to allow the user to generate a random solvable maze on to the canvas via them pressing a button. 
To launch the application the project and all required files should be up and running in whatever IDE (I used IntelliJ) and then the play button should be pressed of the class called Main.

Getting Started
 Run the class Main.
1.	Then a GUI should appear of a maze.
2.	At the bottom of this GUI there should be a button which says "Generate Maze".
3.  Press this button and a new random solvable maze will appear each time it is pressed.
